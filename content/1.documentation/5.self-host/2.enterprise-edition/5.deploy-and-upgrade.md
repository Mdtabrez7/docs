## Upgrade

Upgrading Hoppscotch Enterprise Edition is a simple process. Follow the instructions below to upgrade your Hoppscotch Enterprise Edition instance.

### Using individual containers for the services

1. Check if there is a new version available by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

2. Update the image to the latest version by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-frontend:latest
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-backend:latest
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-admin:latest
    ```

    ::alert{type="info"}
    ::list{type="info"}

    - If you want to update to a specific version, run the following command:

    ::

    ```bash
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-frontend:<version>
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-backend:<version>
    docker pull hoppscotch/hoppscotch-enterprise-admin:<version>
    ```

3. Start the new container by following the instructions in the [Install and build](/documentation/self-host/enterprise-edition/install-and-build#docker) section.
