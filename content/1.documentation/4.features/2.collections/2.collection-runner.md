# Collection Runner

The Collection Runner allows you to sequentially execute all requests within your collection. Each request is executed one by one, and you can review responses while filtering requests based on test result status.

## Running a Collection

To initiate a sequential run:
- Right-click on the collection and select the "Run Collection" option.
- Alternatively, hover over the collection and click on the "Run Collection" icon.

A new tab will open, where you can configure the run settings as described below.

### Run Configurations

1. **Delay**: Set an interval delay (in milliseconds) between running each request.
2. **Stop Run if Error Occurs**: The collection run stops if an error is encountered within a script or if there's a problem sending a request.
3. **Persist Responses**: Log response headers and bodies for review after running the collection. Note that persisting responses may impact performance for large collections.
4. **Keep Variable Values**: Persist the variables used in the run, so any variables updated during the run will retain their changes after completion.

## Viewing the Results

After successfully executing all requests, you can:
- Filter between requests that passed or failed tests.
- Click on an individual request to view its response and access detailed test information.
