# Collection Properties

Collection properties enable you to define settings that universally apply to all requests within the collection.

Authorization details and headers can be specified at the collection level. Subfolders and individual requests within the collection can either inherit these properties or define their custom authentication and headers.

To set collection properties:

1. Right-click on a collection or a subfolder within a collection to open its properties.
2. Specify the authorization and headers that all nested requests or folders should adhere to.
3. If a subfolder should inherit the properties of a parent collection, specify the authorization as "inherit" and leave the headers blank.
