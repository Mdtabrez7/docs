# Embeds
Embeds are a unique type of widget that allows you to share your requests in a special way! When you share a Hoppscotch embed, you can integrate an interactive miniature version of Hoppscotch directly into your websites and blogs. This feature empowers users to test API requests, experiment with query parameters, headers, and more.

This functionality becomes particularly valuable when you are explaining your API endpoint, and you want your readers or audience to have the ability to input their parameters or authorization tokens for direct interaction with your API. Embeds provide a seamless and interactive experience, enhancing the understanding and engagement of your API documentation.

Once you opt to generate an embed, you have the flexibility to configure which options are visible to your audience for interaction. By default, parameters, body, and headers will be displayed to the user, while the authorization tab remains hidden. However, you can customize these options when creating a new embed or by opening the customization menu on an existing shared request.

This customization feature allows you to tailor the embedded experience based on your specific needs, ensuring that your audience interacts with the relevant aspects of the request while maintaining control over the visibility of authorization details.
