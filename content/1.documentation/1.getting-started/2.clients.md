## Understanding the user interface

Hoppscotch has a simple and intuitive UI. The UI is divided into 5 sections:

### Topbar

The top bar is where you can find the search, login, workspace selector, and more. 

### Menu

The menu is where you will find the different platforms that Hoppscotch offers and switch between them. You can also access the settings page from the menu.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is where you can see additional features depending on the platform you are working on. The sidebar houses features like history and collections.

### Main

The main panel is where you will spend most of your time. This is where you will create and send requests and view the responses.

### Footer

The footer houses the status bar. The status bar allows you to toggle the sidebar, go full screen, get help and support, and more.
