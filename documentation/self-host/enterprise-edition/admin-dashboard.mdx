The Admin Dashboard serves as the central hub for managing your workspace and user-related activities. From here, you can efficiently oversee and control various aspects of your platform.

- Insights Dashboard: Gain valuable insights into platform usage.
- Manage Users: Handle user-related actions, such as inviting, elevating admins, and deleting users.
- Manage Workspaces: Create, edit, and delete workspaces while managing workspace-specific details and user memberships.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard section provides an overview of essential metrics and statistics regarding users, workspace, and activity. This snapshot allows you to track the usage and performance of your platform.

Get insights into your organization's usage of Hoppscotch.

- Number of Users: Monitor the count of registered users.
- Number of Workspaces: Keep track of the total number of workspaces.
- Number of Requests: Measure the volume of requests made by your organization.
- Number of Collections: Track the quantity of collections within the platform.

## Manage users

<Info>In Hoppscotch enterprise edition, a user needs to be explicitly invited by the admin to create an account on the platform.</Info>

The Users section empowers you to effectively control user-related actions. It streamlines the process of user management, making it simple to oversee the user base.

- User List: View a comprehensive list of all users and their activity on your platform
- Invite Users: Send invitations to new users, welcoming them to the platform.
- Admin Privileges: Elevate users to administrative roles for increased permissions.
- User Deletion: Delete users when necessary.

### APIs for User Management

The RESTful APIs designed for User Management enable **admins** to perform a wide range of user-related actions, such as inviting new users, deleting existing ones, and updating user details. These APIs provide **admins** with the ability to efficiently manage user accounts and permissions. The table below introduces **seven** key APIs that empower **admins** with greater control over user management.

| User Activity | Description | Method | Endpoint | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Invite a New User | Allows admins to invite a new user to the self-hosted instance. | POST | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| View Pending Invites | Retrieves a list of all pending invites sent to new users. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| Delete Pending Invites | Enables admins to delete specific pending invites using their User ID. | DELETE | `<base-url>/v1/infra/user-invitations` | 
| View All Users | Provides a list of all users in the self-hosted instance. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users` | 
| View a Particular User | Fetches details of a specific user in the self-hosted instance by their User ID. | GET | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}` | 
| Update User Details | Allows admins to update the details of an existing user. | PATCH | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/{uid}` |
| Manage Admin Status | Enables admins to add or remove admin status for an existing user. | PATCH | `<base-url>/v1/infra/users/:id/admin-status` | 

To interact with User Management APIs, please ensure the Backend service runs on your server or local machine. Open your browser, navigate to our **[Swagger Documentation](https://stage-shc.hoppscotch.io/backend/api-docs)** to view API specifications, and test the APIs directly.

### Infra-tokens

InfraTokens are special UUID tokens that provide a secure way for admins to interface with Self-Hosted APIs. They are exclusively accessible to admins, ensuring that only authorized personnel can manage sensitive operations. Unlike Personal Access Tokens, which are tied to individual users, InfraTokens are scoped at the instance level, granting access to all admins within the instance.

#### Steps to Generate an InfraToken

Follow these steps to create a new InfraToken:

1. After logging into your Self-Hosted instance using your admin credentials, you can access the **“Tokens”** under the “Settings” section from your admin dashboard.
2. Click on **"Generate New InfraToken."**
3. Enter a title for the token and select an expiration date. Available options include 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or no expiry.
4. After providing the necessary details, confirm the creation. **The new InfraToken will be displayed once, make sure to copy it securely** to your clipboard for immediate use.
5. If you decide that you no longer need the token, you can delete it by navigating back to **“Tokens Section”.**

<Note> The details of the admin who created the InfraToken are stored for audit purposes. All admins can view and manage these tokens. </Note>

## Manage Workspaces

In the Manage Workspace section, you can efficiently handle workspace-related operations, ensuring that collaborations and projects run smoothly.

- Workspace Creation: Establish new workspaces tailored to specific projects or departments.
- Workspace Editing: Modify workspace details and configurations as needed.
- Workspace Deletion: Disband workspaces that are no longer relevant.
- User Memberships: View and manage the users associated with each workspace.
