Environments are also useful when you need to manage shared data with a team. You can create environments and share them with your team members.

Click on the "**Environments**" icon on the sidebar to create environments.

<Tip>You can add your variables to the `Global` environment, which can be accessed globally, ie. in every other environment.</Tip>

## Using scripts

You can also create and delete environment variables using scripts by using the `pw` object..

```javascript
pw.env.set("variable", "value"); // Creates an environment variable 
pw.env.unset("variable"); // Deletes the environment variable
```
