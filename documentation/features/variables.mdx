Hoppscotch gives you the ability to create and use variables throughout the app. This helps you reuse values throughout Hoppscotch just by invoking the variable name. 

Hoppscotch considers an object within an angular bracket as a variable `<<variable>>`.

## Variable Scopes

Hoppscotch provides you with different variable scopes, allowing you to use the right scope for the situation.

1. Global Variables: can be accessed throughout Hoppscotch and has the broadest scope of all variables. 
2. Environment Variables: allow your variables to be scoped to an environment. Environment variables are useful when you have the same set of variables for two environments such as production and staging.
3. Request Variables: are scoped to just an individual request, request variables are useful when you want to use variables in your URL path or when you want to embed a variable URL.

The scope of each variable can be identified from the color of the variable name 

| Variable Scope | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Global | Blue |
| Environment | Green |
| Request | Orange |
| Non resolvable | Red |
